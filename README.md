# hashcode2020
Our solution to the HashCode 2020 online qualification round (we were the team `The Bing Boys`). It scored 16,405,978 points, which was higher than any other team with the word "Bing" in the team name. That's a win for us!

The solution is almost entirely deterministic, which worked surprisingly well. For `d_tough_choices`, some randomness needs to be introduced for speed-up. We didn't consider that scenario much when writing most of the code.
